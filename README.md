The project is in Beta tests. The idea is doing an app who will create a hybrid multiboot usb drive with compatibility for Bios Legacy and UEFI, suports ISOs of Linux and Windows.

## TODO:
- Add valid Menuentry for Windows systems at grub.cfg
- PySide2 to GUI mode
- Think in better way to extract ISOs content. 7z ??
